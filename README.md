# Cars REST API
Main functionality of this program is to manage cars collection. It can provide data of cars sorted by particular order,
attributes as well as statistics of collection. It also has security layer, where we can register, sign in, authorise and 
authenticate users and requests sent by them. Following clips display those abilities as well as some use cases:
